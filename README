A bit funny Everfeeds.com code repository.

Notice the main concepts of Everfeeds itself:

- _Gather_. Collect from anywhere.
- _Focus_. Allow people to make a focus on information they are interested in.
- _Filter_. Divide focused information and crap.
- _Present_. Content should be presented clearly and be easy to get.

Take look on [[wiki]] for details.
